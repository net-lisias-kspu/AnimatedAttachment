# Animated Attachment /L Unleashed :: Known Issues

* [#3](https://github.com/KSPKatten/AnimatedAttachment/issues/3) There is a caveat for physics-less parts - while they and any other physics-less sub-parts to them will move with the animation, any physics-enabled sub-parts will not. For example, a cubic strut connected to a hinge will move with it, but a tank connected to the cubic strut will not.
